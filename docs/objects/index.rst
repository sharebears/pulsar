JSON Object Documentation
=========================
Here are the JSON serializations of public-facing models. They are found
in various API responses and listed once here instead of multiple times
elsewhere. Attributes/keys of objects are permissioned and restricted based on
the accessing user, as well as whether or not they are nested in another
object. Every object on this page will have an example JSON and what each
attribute/key is.
